# Simple Vanilla JS 1
This simple example is a variation from the content available in [mdn web docs > Guides > Getting started with the web > JavaScript basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics) **(feel free to do a walkthrough over its [A "Hello world!" example](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics#a_hello_world!_example) section and come back here afterwards to get more context)** but with a slight twist by using the javascript code as a function called `userClick` as a handler when user clicking a button to perform the following actions:
1. Change inner text of an `h1` element back and forth between `"My Text"` and `"Javascript is Cool!"`.
2. Adding a class **(courtesy of [animate.css library](https://animate.style/) by adding a link to its [CDN](https://animate.style/#usage))** that applies a "shake" effect to the text for a 500 millisecond duration.

## Explanation
[/index.html](./index.html) is a simple HTML page that defined n `h1` element with some text, a button that has its `onclick` property set to `"userClick()"` and a `script` element whose `src` property is set to [scripts/demo.js](./scripts/demo.js)

[/scripts/demo.js](./scripts/demo.js) is a javascript file that initializes the `toggle` variable to `true`, the `originalText` to the text content of the `h1` element (`"My Text"`) and the `currentText` variable to `''` **(empty string)**. It also defines the `userClick` function **(it wont get invoked until user clicks on the button)** that gets the header, adds the "animated" CSS class to apply the "shake" animation and switches the toggle state so original text of the `h1` element gets replaced with "JavaScript is Cool!"
